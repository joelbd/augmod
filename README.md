Automated Galactic Modeling (AuGMod) is a python package that brings together different tools used for detecting and modeling galaxies.

It will include:
  - Automated cropping given coordinates
    - Initially this will be XY coordinates only but will be expanded to accept any coordinates available in the image.
  - Galfit processing
  - All results will be inserted into an dataframe and entered into an SQL database if directed by the user
